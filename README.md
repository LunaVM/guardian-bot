IMPORTANT:

Create a file in the same directory as the bot called .env, then place this one liner in:
TOKEN=(your token here)
**REPLACE (your token here) with the actual bot token**
_(no, I'm not adding one here for you to use)_

Then in the bot settings, enable the Server Members and Message Content Intent

To run the bot, open a cmd window (or shell window on linux)

Run npm i (or npm install). Wait for it to finish. Then run node main.js to run the bot.
